# This page is practice on lists, sets, Big O, and a little on linked lists

# References are listed, although much of what is referenced was modified into functions by myself for further
# exploration of the subjects

# Although referenced, the functions at the end were edited/adjusted by me to fit
# some of my own study needs for arguments and efficiency on how I might want a function
# to occur during any future efforts

# More notes about sets:
# Reasons to utilize sets instead of lists:
# 1) Want to know if element exists, don't care how many, order, etc
# 2) When looking for unique elements or add and remove despite location
# 3) Determining multiple or duplicate elements


# How to determine if there are duplicates on a list (convert it to a set first):
newlist = [3, 5, 8, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 7]
print("Here is a new list:")
print(newlist)
print('\n')

listAsSet = set(newlist)
print('\n')

print("Here is the new list converted to a set:")
print(listAsSet)
print('\n')

# convert to set and check length of set versus length of original list
dup = len(listAsSet) == len(newlist)

print('Following will state if the lists are duplicate:')
print(dup)
print('\n')

dup = len(listAsSet) != len(newlist)

print('Following will state if the lists are different:')
print(dup)
print('\n')

# results:
# Here is a new list:
# [3, 5, 8, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 7]
# Here is the new list converted to a set:
# {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
# Following will state if the lists are duplicate:
# False
# Following will state if the lists are different:
# True

# Side note: converting a set to a list is O(n) because have to go through all elements of list to convert
